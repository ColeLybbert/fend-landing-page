# Landing Page

This is a project that was made to test my JavaScript Skills, there is a lack of design but the functionality is all there in the JavaScript Page.

# JavaScript

 Line 1-3: Defining every Section and the Nav Bar.

 Line 5-14: Creating a 'li' and 'a' giving them an id, an href, and attaching them to Nav Bar.

 Line 16-19: Defining each section top and bottom for scroll listener
 
 Line 36-62: Using and Event Listener and If Else statement to decide if the screen is over any of the Sections and if so adding classes. If the screen isn't over the sections it removes the classes.
